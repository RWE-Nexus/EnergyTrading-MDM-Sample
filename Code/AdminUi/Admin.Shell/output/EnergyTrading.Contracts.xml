            <summary>
            Simple representation of an Atom link, sufficient to be included in an XML message.
            <para>
            Atom is not fully representable in XML schema, but this form gives us enough to
            use the link element.

            <summary>
            Gets or sets the target href.
            <para>
            atom:link elements MUST have an href attribute, whose value MUST be a IRI reference

        <member name="P:EnergyTrading.Contracts.Atom.Link.Rel">
            <summary>
            Gets or sets the link relationship type; optional.
            <para>
            Elements MAY have a "rel" attribute that indicates the link
            relation type.  If the "rel" attribute is not present, the link
            element MUST be interpreted as if the link relation type is
            "alternate".

        <member name="P:EnergyTrading.Contracts.Atom.Link.Type">
            <summary>
            Gets or sets the link type.
            <para>
            the "type" attribute's value is an advisory
            media type: it is a hint about the type of the representation that is
            expected to be returned when the value of the href attribute is
            dereferenced.  Note that the type attribute does not override the
            actual media type returned with the representation.  Link elements
            MAY have a type attribute, whose value MUST conform to the syntax of
            a MIME media type [MIMEREG].
